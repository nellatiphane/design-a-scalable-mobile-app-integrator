 * 
 * This project aims to design a scalable mobile app integrator, which enables seamless 
 * communication and data exchange between various mobile applications.
 * 
 * The integrator will provide a unified interface for different apps to interact, 
 * facilitating features such as single sign-on, data sharing, and unified notification systems.
 * 
 * The design will focus on scalability, flexibility, and security, ensuring that the integrator 
 * can adapt to an increasing number of connected apps and users.
 * 
 * Architecture:
 * 
 * 1. API Gateway: Acts as the entry point for all mobile apps, handling incoming requests and 
 *                 routing them to the appropriate microservices.
 * 2. Microservices: Responsible for specific functionalities such as authentication, data storage, 
 *                  and notification management. These services will be designed to scale independently.
 * 3. Service Registry: Maintains a registry of all connected microservices, enabling the API Gateway 
 *                    to discover and route requests to the appropriate service.
 * 4. Data Storage: A scalable data storage solution will be used to store and manage data exchanged 
 *                 between mobile apps.
 * 
 * Key Features:
 * 
 * 1. Single Sign-On (SSO): Enables users to access multiple apps with a single set of credentials.
 * 2. Data Sharing: Allows apps to share data and resources, enhancing user experience and functionality.
 * 3. Unified Notification System: Provides a centralized notification system for all connected apps.
 * 4. Scalability: Designed to handle a large number of connected apps and users, ensuring seamless performance.
 * 5. Security: Implements robust security measures to protect user data and ensure secure communication.
 * 
 * Technologies:
 * 
 * 1. Java: Used for building the API Gateway and microservices.
 * 2. Spring Boot: Utilized for rapid development and easier maintenance of microservices.
 * 3. Docker: Enables containerization of microservices, ensuring efficient deployment and scaling.
 * 4. Kubernetes: Provides orchestration and management of containerized microservices.
 * 5. MongoDB: Used for scalable and flexible data storage.
 * 
 * Class Structure:
 * 
 * 1. Integrator.java: Acts as the main entry point, responsible for initializing the integrator.
 * 2. APIGateway.java: Handles incoming requests and routes them to the appropriate microservices.
 * 3. Microservice.java: Abstract class for microservices, providing common functionalities.
 * 4. AuthService.java: Responsible for authentication and SSO functionality.
 * 5. DataSharingService.java: Enables data sharing between apps.
 * 6. NotificationService.java: Handles unified notification system.
 * 
 * Todo:
 * 
 * 1. Implement API Gateway and microservices.
 * 2. Develop data storage solution using MongoDB.
 * 3. Integrate notification system with microservices.
 * 4. Test and deploy the integrator using Docker and Kubernetes.
